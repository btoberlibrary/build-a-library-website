### State Library Website Hosting Programs

eBranch in a Box is an initiative from the Idaho Commission for Libraries (ICfL) to assist Idaho libraries in having a web presence, which is defined as having a vital website that is an extension of the library providing information about or access to library services.

The State Libraryâ€™s Network & Resource Sharing department (NRS) provides websites free-of-charge for libraries, museums, and related organizations.

More than 40 Colorado Libraries and other organizations are using this service already.
