### State Library Website Hosting Programs
#### [Idaho Commission for Libraries | eBranch](https://ebranch.lili.org/)
eBranch in a Box is an initiative from the Idaho Commission for Libraries (ICfL) to assist Idaho libraries in having a web presence, which is defined as having a vital website that is an extension of the library providing information about or access to library services.
#### [Nebraska Libraries on the Web](https://libraries.ne.gov/projectblog/)
Through this project, the Nebraska Library Commission will help your public library set up a free website. We use WordPress to make the website easier to set up and maintain.
