### State Library Website Hosting Programs
#### [Idaho Commission for Libraries | eBranch](https://ebranch.lili.org/)
eBranch in a Box is an initiative from the Idaho Commission for Libraries (ICfL) to assist Idaho libraries in having a web presence, which is defined as having a vital website that is an extension of the library providing information about or access to library services.
#### [Nebraska Libraries on the Web](https://libraries.ne.gov/projectblog/)
Through this project, the Nebraska Library Commission will help your public library set up a free website. We use WordPress to make the website easier to set up and maintain.
#### [Colorado Virtual Library](https://www.coloradovirtuallibrary.org/technology/websites/)
The State Libraryâ€™s Network & Resource Sharing department (NRS) provides websites free-of-charge for libraries, museums, and related organizations. NRS can help you create your site, host it for free, and deliver hands-on training to help you keep your site up and running. More than 40 Colorado Libraries and other organizations are using this service already.
####[Michigan Public Libraies in the Cloud (PLOUD)](https://www.michlibrary.org/)  
The Library of Michigan subsidizes website hosting for Michigan libraries through Ploud (Public Libraries in the Cloud). Ploud serves over half of the small and rural libraries in the lower peninsula.
